# Isles of Resistance

## Overview
"Isles of Resistance" is a single-player turn-based defense game set in a fictional archipelago. The player defends their islands against an AI-controlled air invasion using strategic deployments on a hex-based map. The game features real-time animations, a research system, and an adaptive AI opponent.

## Features
- **Turn-based Strategy:** Player vs. AI, alternating turns.
- **Hex-based Map:** Terrain impacts movement and strategy.
- **Fog of War:** Limited visibility, reconnaissance upgrades available.
- **Resource Management:** Balance building defenses, research, and counterattacks.
- **Enemy AI:** Dynamic AI that adapts to the playerâ€™s tactics.
- **Research System:** Unlock new defenses and upgrades.
- **Real-time Battle Animations:** Graphical representation of combat, skippable for fast play.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** JavaScript (React for UI, animations)
- **Backend:** Python (Automation and AI enhancements)
- **Networking:** WebSockets & REST API
- **Database:** SQLite (Local for now, expandable to AWS DynamoDB)
- **Deployment:** AWS (EC2 for backend, S3 & CloudFront for frontend, Lambda for automation)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + AWS CodePipeline
- **Testing:** Google Test (C++), Jest (JavaScript)
